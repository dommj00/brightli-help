    <h1>Privacy Policy for Brightli</h1>
    
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> August 7, 2025</p>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> August 7, 2025</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Brightli ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our personal planning and reflection app collects, uses, and protects your information.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Our Core Privacy Promise:</strong> Brightli is designed with privacy at its foundation. All your personal data, including your activities, ratings, reflections, and insights stays on your device or in your personal cloud storage. We do not have access to, collect, or store your personal content on our servers.</p>

    <h2>Information We Do and Do Not Collect</h2>

    <h3>Information We Do NOT Collect or Access</h3>
    <p><strong>Your Personal Content:</strong> We cannot access your scheduled activities, task lists, activity ratings, reflection responses, or any insights generated by the app</p>
    <p><strong>Your Usage Patterns:</strong> We do not track how you use the app, which features you access, or your behavioral patterns within the app</p>
    <p><strong>Location Data:</strong> We do not collect or access your location information</p>
    <p><strong>Device Information:</strong> We do not collect information about your device, including device identifiers, operating system details, or hardware specifications</p>
    <p><strong>Photos or Media:</strong> We do not access your photos, camera, or other media files</p>
    <p><strong>Contact Information:</strong> We do not access your contacts or communication history</p>

    <h3>Information We May Collect</h3>
    <p><strong>Account Registration:</strong> If you choose to provide your name during the app's onboarding process, this information is stored locally on your device and is not transmitted to us.</p>
    
    <p><strong>App Store Information:</strong> We may receive basic information from the App Store (Apple App Store or Google Play Store) related to your app download and subscription status, in accordance with standard app store practices. This may include:</p>
    <p>Basic subscription status (active, expired, etc.)</p>
    <p>App version information</p>
    <p>General geographic region (country level only)</p>

    <h2>How Your Data is Stored</h2>

    <h3>Local Device Storage</h3>
    <p>All your personal data is stored directly on your mobile device using secure local storage methods. This includes:</p>
    <p>Your activities and schedules</p>
    <p>Activity ratings and feedback</p>
    <p>Reflection responses and insights</p>
    <p>App preferences and settings</p>
    <p>Any patterns or analytics generated by the app</p>

    <h3>Cloud Storage (Your Personal Cloud)</h3>
    <p>When you enable device backup features (such as iCloud for iOS devices), your Brightli data may be backed up to your personal cloud storage account. This backup is:</p>
    <p>Controlled entirely by you and your device's backup settings</p>
    <p>Encrypted according to your cloud provider's security standards</p>
    <p>Not accessible to Brightli or any third parties</p>
    <p>Managed under your cloud provider's privacy policy (not ours)</p>

    <h2>Data Sharing and Third Parties</h2>
    <p><strong>We do not share your data with third parties</strong> because we do not have access to your personal data in the first place.</p>
    
    <p><strong>No Third-Party Services:</strong> Brightli does not integrate with or send data to:</p>
    <p>Analytics services</p>
    <p>Advertising networks</p>
    <p>Social media platforms</p>
    <p>Marketing services</p>
    <p>Data brokers</p>
    <p>Any other third-party services</p>

    <p><strong>No Government or Law Enforcement Access:</strong> Since we do not store your personal data on our servers, we cannot provide your personal information to government agencies or law enforcement, even if requested.</p>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>Since your data never leaves your control, you maintain complete security over your information. We recommend:</p>
    <p>Keeping your device updated with the latest security patches</p>
    <p>Using device lock features (passcode, fingerprint, face recognition)</p>
    <p>Regularly backing up your device to your personal cloud storage</p>
    <p>Being mindful of who has access to your unlocked device</p>

    <h2>Your Data Rights and Control</h2>

    <h3>Complete Ownership</h3>
    <p>You have complete ownership and control over all your data because it resides solely on your device.</p>

    <h3>Data Export</h3>
    <p><strong>Premium Feature:</strong> Data export functionality is available to Premium subscribers. You can export your reflection responses and activity data directly from within the app. Exported data includes:</p>
    <p>Your reflections and responses</p>
    <p>Created activities with scheduling information</p>
    <p>Activity ratings and feedback</p>
    <p>All associated metadata</p>
    <p><strong>Free Tier Users:</strong> While export is a Premium feature, you maintain complete control over your data through the app's interface and can always upgrade to Premium for export functionality.</p>

    <h3>Data Deletion</h3>
    <p>To delete your data:</p>
    <p><strong>Delete from App:</strong> Use the app's built-in deletion features to remove specific activities, reflections, or all data</p>
    <p><strong>Complete Removal:</strong> Uninstall the app from your device to remove all locally stored data</p>
    <p><strong>Cloud Backup Removal:</strong> Manage your cloud backups through your device's backup settings</p>

    <h3>No Account Deletion Needed</h3>
    <p>Since we do not maintain user accounts or store your data on our servers, there is no account deletion process required.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Brightli can be used by individuals of all ages. However, since we do not collect personal information from users of any age, we do not have specific procedures for handling children's data. All data remains on the user's device regardless of age.</p>
    
    <p>Parents and guardians should be aware that:</p>
    <p>Any data entered by children remains on the device</p>
    <p>Parents control access through device parental controls</p>
    <p>Parents manage any cloud backup of the app's data through device settings</p>

    <h2>Changes to Data Practices</h2>
    <p>If we ever change our approach to data collection or storage, we will:</p>
    <p>Update this Privacy Policy with clear notice of changes</p>
    <p>Provide prominent notification within the app</p>
    <p>Give users the opportunity to review and accept any new data practices</p>
    <p>Maintain our commitment to user privacy and control</p>

    <h2>International Data Considerations</h2>
    <p>Since your data remains on your device:</p>
    <p>No international data transfers occur through Brightli</p>
    <p>Your data is subject to the laws of your jurisdiction</p>
    <p>Any cloud backup transfers are governed by your cloud provider's policies</p>
    <p>You maintain complete control regardless of your location</p>

    <h2>Technical Implementation</h2>

    <h3>App Store Compliance</h3>
    <p>Brightli complies with Apple App Store and Google Play Store privacy requirements while maintaining our commitment to local data storage.</p>

    <h3>Updates and Sync</h3>
    <p>App updates do not affect your stored data</p>
    <p>No synchronization occurs with external servers</p>
    <p>All data remains local to your device and personal cloud backups</p>

    <h2>Contact Information</h2>
    <p>If you have questions about this Privacy Policy or our data practices, you can contact us at:</p>
    <p><strong>Email:</strong> info@brightliapp.com</p>
    <p>Since we do not collect your personal data, we cannot access your information to address data-related requests. All data management must be performed by you using the app's built-in features or your device's settings.</p>

    <h2>California Privacy Rights (CCPA)</h2>
    <p>If you are a California resident, you have specific rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), even though our local-first data approach means we collect minimal personal information.</p>

    <h3>Your CCPA Rights:</h3>
    <p><strong>Right to Know:</strong> You can request information about what personal information we collect, use, or disclose</p>
    <p><strong>Right to Delete:</strong> You can request deletion of your personal information that we may have</p>
    <p><strong>Right to Opt-Out:</strong> You can opt out of the sale of your personal information</p>
    <p><strong>Right to Non-Discrimination:</strong> We will not discriminate against you for exercising your CCPA rights</p>

    <h3>How These Rights Apply to Brightli:</h3>
    <p><strong>Information We Collect:</strong> We collect minimal personal information as described in this policy</p>
    <p><strong>No Sale of Data:</strong> We do not sell personal information to third parties</p>
    <p><strong>Local Data Storage:</strong> Since your app data stays on your device, you maintain direct control over your information</p>
    <p><strong>Deletion:</strong> You can delete your data directly through the app or by uninstalling the app</p>

    <h3>Exercising Your Rights:</h3>
    <p>To exercise your CCPA rights or ask questions about our data practices, contact us at info@brightliapp.com. Please note that since your personal app data is stored locally on your device, most data management must be performed by you using the app's built-in features.</p>

    <h2>Legal Compliance</h2>
    <p>This Privacy Policy complies with applicable privacy laws including:</p>
    <p>California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)</p>
    <p>Other applicable state and federal privacy laws</p>
    <p>Our local-first approach inherently provides the highest level of privacy protection, often exceeding the requirements of these regulations.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> This app is currently available in the United States, Canada, and Mexico only.</p>

    <p><strong>By using Brightli, you acknowledge that you have read and understood this Privacy Policy. Your continued use of the app constitutes acceptance of these practices.</strong></p>
