        </div>

        <!-- Planner -->
        <div class="guide-section">
            <h2>Planner</h2>
            <p>Brightli as a planner displays a central hub for scheduling and managing all your activities.</p>
            
            <h3>Today's Tasks</h3>
            <p>The main view shows your activities scheduled for today, giving you a clear snapshot of what's ahead. Each activity displays its category, time, and completion status at a glance.</p>
            
            <h3>Multiple Layouts</h3>
            <p>Brightli offers three distinct layout options to match your preference:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Card Layout:</strong> A simple display for your scheduled activities.</li>
                <li><strong>Timeline Layout:</strong> Activities arranged chronologically with time markers, ideal for time-based planning.</li>
                <li><strong>Compact Layout:</strong> A condensed list view that displays important details about your activities.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Calendar Views</h3>
            <p>Switch between weekly and monthly calendars to plan ahead or review your current activities. The calendar makes it easy to navigate between dates and get a broader view of your schedule.</p>
            
            <h3>Tracking & Completed Tiles</h3>
            <p>The Tracking tiles shows all activities you've marked for reflection and the Completed view lets you review what you've accomplished. These views help you stay on top of pending reflections and celebrate your progress.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Reflections & Journal -->
        <div class="guide-section">
            <h2>Reflections & Journal Entries</h2>
            <p>The reflection system is the heart of Brightli's intelligence. This is where activities become insights once you've completed your pending reflections.</p>
            
            <h3>What Are Reflections?</h3>
            <p>Reflections are thoughtful prompts that appear after you mark tracked activities as complete. They help you pause to consider how you experienced the activity, what could be better, and consider a different approach.</p>
            
            <p>Each reflection begins by requesting a 1-5 star rating then assignes an appropriate question that is selected based on your activity type, category, and past patterns. This becomes more than just tracking activities, it blossoms into understanding.</p>
            
            <h3>Creating & Editing</h3>
            <p>You can add reflections to any completed activity, or create standalone journal entries anytime. Edit your reflections or journal entries later if you want to add more thoughts and delete them if you choose to.</p>
            
            <h3>Journal Entries</h3>
            <p>Beyond activity reflections, you can create journal entries to capture thoughts, gratitude, or daily observations. These entries may complement your activity reflections and enrich your personal growth journey.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Insights -->
        <div class="guide-section">
            <h2>Data Insights</h2>
            <p>Brightli transforms your reflections into actionable patterns and personalized guidance.</p>
            
            <h3>How Insights Help You Grow</h3>
            <p>Imagine realizing that you consistently rate morning workouts higher than evening ones, or discovering that your creative projects thrive when you schedule them after lunch. These patterns aren't always obvious in the moment, but over time, your will reflections reveal them.</p>
            
            <p>Brightli analyzes your activity ratings, reflection responses, and completion patterns to surface trends you might miss. This helps you make smarter decisions about when, where, and how to pursue your goals.</p>
            
            <h3>Getting the Best Insights</h3>
            <p>The more you reflect thoughtfully, the more accurate your insights become. Aim to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Complete reflections for at least 10-15 activities before expecting meaningful patterns</li>
                <li>Be honest in your ratings, they're private and for your benefit</li>
                <li>Reflect consistently rather than sporadically</li>
                <li>Track a variety of activity types to see cross-category patterns</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Understanding the Insight Tabs</h3>
            <p>Brightli organizes insights into focused areas:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Overview:</strong> Your headline insights and overall patterns at a glance</li>
                <li><strong>Performance:</strong> Completion rates, consistency streaks, and activity distribution across categories</li>
                <li><strong>Mood & Energy:</strong> How different activities and times of day affect your wellbeing based on reflection data</li>
                <li><strong>Patterns:</strong> Deeper behavioral trends, like which activities you're most likely to skip or which contexts lead to better experiences</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Each tab presents data visually through charts or written insights to make complex data easy to understand and act on.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Customizations -->
        <div class="guide-section">
            <h2>Customizations</h2>
            <p>Make Brightli feel like yours with personalization options.</p>
            
            <h3>Theme Selection</h3>
            <p>Choose from over 40 beautiful themes to match your mood and style. Free users have access to 3 core themes, while Premium unlocks the full collection including seasonal, mood, and classic options.</p>
            
            <h3>Activity Layouts</h3>
            <p>Switch between Card, Timeline, and Compact layouts to match how you prefer to view your activities. Your layout choice applies across all views displaying your activities.</p>
            
            <h3>Activity Category Sets</h3>
            <p>Brightli offers different category frameworks to match your focus areas. Whether you're optimizing for wellness, creativity, or productivity, there's a category set designed for your journey. Switching between sets is seamless and designed to maintain your progress.</p>
            
            <h3>Activity Autocomplete</h3>
            <p>Brightli can automatically mark activities as complete when they're overdue to help you keep your schedule accurate without manual cleanup.</p>
            
            <h4>How It Works:</h4>
            <p>When an activity's scheduled time plus its duration have expired, Brightli can automatically mark it complete for you. For example, if you scheduled "Morning Workout" for 8:00 AM with a 30-minute duration, it will be autocompleted at 9:30 AM (8:00 + 0:30 + 1:00 hour buffer).</p>
            
            <h4>Autocomplete Modes:</h4>
            <p>You can choose how autocomplete behaves in Settings → Customizations:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Off:</strong> Activities never autocomplete - you maintain full manual control</li>
                <li><strong>Untracked Activities Only:</strong> Only activities without tracking enabled (no reflection tracking) are autocompleted. Tracked activities requiring your reflection remain pending until you manually complete them</li>
                <li><strong>All Activities:</strong> Both tracked and untracked activities autocomplete when overdue. Tracked activities create pending reflections that you can complete later</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>What Autocomplete Does:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Marks overdue activities as complete based on their scheduled time + duration + 1 hour buffer</li>
                <li>For untracked activities: Moves them directly to your completed list</li>
                <li>For tracked activities: Marks them complete and creates a pending reflection in the Reflections tile on the main screen</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>What Autocomplete Doesn't Do:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>It doesn't fill in reflection responses for you</li>
                <li>It doesn't mark activities complete before their time + duration + buffer has passed</li>
                <li>It doesn't affect your ability to complete activities manually at any time</li>
            </ul>

        <!-- Quotes -->
        <div class="guide-section">
            <h2>Daily Quotes & Quote Schedule</h2>

            <h3>Quote Schedule</h3>

        <!-- iCloud Sync -->
        <div class="guide-section">
            <h2>iCloud Sync</h2>
            <p>Keep your data synchronized across all your Apple devices (Premium feature).</p>

            <div class="tip-box">
                <strong>💡 Tip:</strong>

            <p>The advanced system analyzes your activity history, previous ratings, and reflection responses to ask increasingly relevant questions. If you consistently rate certain activities highly, Brightli might ask what specific factors contribute to that success.
