        <div class="legal-content">
            <p>Welcome to Brightli! These Terms of Use govern your use of the Brightli mobile application and related services. By using our app, you agree to these terms.</p>

            <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
            <p>By downloading, installing, or using the Brightli application ("App"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Use ("Terms"). If you do not agree to these Terms, please do not use the App.</p>

            <h2>2. Description of Service</h2>
            <p>Brightli is an activity planning and intelligent reflection app designed to help users learn from their own activities and build personal growth patterns. The app provides activity planning and scheduling tools, activity rating and reflection tracking, personalized questions and insights, progress tracking and analytics, customizable themes, daily inspirational quotes, and optional cloud synchronization via iCloud.</p>

            <h2>3. User Accounts and Registration</h2>
            <p>To access certain features, you may need to create an account. You agree to provide accurate, current, and complete information and maintain the confidentiality of your account credentials. We reserve the right to terminate accounts that violate these Terms.</p>

            <h2>4. Subscription Services and Payments</h2>
            
            <h3>4.1 Premium Subscription</h3>
            <p>Brightli offers premium subscription services that provide access to advanced reflection questions and insights, unlimited activity tracking, all premium themes, iCloud synchronization, detailed analytics, and data export functionality.</p>

            <h3>4.2 Free Trial</h3>
            <p>We may offer a free trial period for Premium features. You may cancel your trial at any time without charge during the trial period.</p>

            <h3>4.3 Billing and Payment</h3>
            <p>Premium subscriptions are billed through the Apple App Store. Payment will be charged upon confirmation of purchase. Subscriptions automatically renew unless cancelled at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.</p>

            <div class="important-notice">
                <p style="margin:0;"><strong>Important:</strong> Subscriptions are managed through the Apple App Store. We cannot directly process refunds or subscription changes. Refunds are subject to Apple's App Store refund policy.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>5. User Content and Data</h2>
            <p>You retain ownership of all personal information, reflections, and activities you input into the App. We do not claim ownership of your data. Brightli is designed with privacy at its core—your data is stored locally on your device and, if enabled, in your personal iCloud storage. We do not have access to your activities, reflections, or insights.</p>

            <h2>6. Acceptable Use</h2>
            <p>You agree to use the App only for its intended purposes and in compliance with these Terms. You may not reverse engineer, decompile, or extract source code, use the App for commercial purposes without consent, attempt unauthorized access, interfere with functionality, or violate any applicable laws.</p>

            <h2>7. Intellectual Property Rights</h2>
            <p>The Brightli App, including its design, features, and content, is owned by us and protected by copyright and other intellectual property laws. We grant you a limited, non-exclusive license to use the App for personal, non-commercial purposes.</p>

            <div class="important-notice">
                <p><strong>Important Notice:</strong> Brightli is designed for personal productivity and self-reflection purposes only. It is not intended to provide professional advice, therapy, or treatment.</p>
                <p style="margin-top:1rem; margin-bottom:0;">The App is not a substitute for professional counseling, therapy, or mental health treatment. You should consult with qualified professionals regarding any mental health concerns. Individual results may vary, and we cannot guarantee specific outcomes.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>9. Privacy and Data Protection</h2>
            <p>Your privacy is important to us. Our <a href="privacy.html" style="color: var(--primary-blue);">Privacy Policy</a> explains how we collect, use, and protect your information. By using the App, you consent to the collection and use of information as described in our Privacy Policy.</p>

            <h2>10. Disclaimers and Limitation of Liability</h2>
            <p>The App is provided "as is" and "as available." We make no warranties regarding the App's performance, availability, or fitness for a particular purpose. To the maximum extent permitted by law, we shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages. Our total liability shall not exceed the amount you have paid us in the twelve months preceding the claim.</p>

            <h2>11. Third-Party Services</h2>
            <p>The App may integrate with third-party services including Apple iCloud, social media platforms, and the Apple App Store. We are not responsible for the availability, content, or practices of these services. Your use of third-party services is subject to their respective terms and privacy policies.</p>

            <h2>12. Updates and Modifications</h2>
            <p>We may release updates to improve functionality, add features, or fix bugs. Some updates may be required for continued use. We may modify these Terms at any time, and material changes will be communicated through the App or via email.</p>

            <h2>13. Termination</h2>
            <p>You may stop using the App at any time. We may terminate or suspend your access immediately for breach of these Terms. Upon termination, data stored locally on your device remains accessible to you, but cloud synchronization and premium features will no longer be available.</p>

            <h2>14. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution</h2>
            <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Maryland and the United States. Disputes will be resolved through binding arbitration rather than in court, except for disputes that may be taken to small claims court.</p>

            <h2>15. Age Requirements</h2>
