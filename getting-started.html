                <strong>💡 System Requirements</strong>
                <p>Brightli requires iOS 14.0 or later. The app works completely offline and stores all your data locally on your device for maximum privacy.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="guide-section">
            <h2>Step 2: Quick Setup</h2>
            <p>Your first launch includes a brief onboarding experience:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Welcome & Introduction:</strong> Learn about Brightli's unique approach to planning with reflection</li>
                <li><strong>Name Setup:</strong> Add your name to personalize the experience</li>
                <li><strong>Choose Your Categories:</strong> Select how you want to organize your activities—Default, Lifestyle, or Creative</li>
                <li><strong>Pick Your First Theme:</strong> Choose from 3 free themes (with 40+ premium options available)</li>
            </ul>
            
            <div class="info-box">
                <strong>About Category Sets</strong>
                <p>Brightli offers three ways to organize activities. Each uses the same four core categories but with different naming that resonates with different goals:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Default:</strong> Happy, Strong, Organized, Smart (what you're striving for)</li>
                    <li><strong>Lifestyle:</strong> Heart, Body, Life, Mind (parts of you that benefit)</li>
                    <li><strong>Creative:</strong> Connect, Move, Create, Think (actions you take)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>You can switch between these anytime; your data and insights seamlessly adapt to your new framework.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="guide-section">
            <h2>Step 3: Understanding Categories & Reflection Intelligence</h2>
            <p>Categories are the foundation of Brightli's reflection intelligence. When you assign an activity to a category, you're helping Brightli understand the type of experience to ask about.</p>
            
            <h3>How It Works</h3>
            <p>Each category influences which reflection questions you'll receive:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Physical Activities (Strong/Body/Move):</strong> Questions about energy, physical sensations, and body awareness</li>
                <li><strong>Mental Activities (Smart/Mind/Think):</strong> Questions about focus, learning, and cognitive engagement</li>
                <li><strong>Social/Emotional (Happy/Heart/Connect):</strong> Questions about relationships, mood, and emotional experiences</li>
                <li><strong>Life Management (Organized/Life/Create):</strong> Questions about productivity, systems, and daily life</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Smart Categorization</h3>
            <p>Brightli learns from your activity names to suggest categories automatically. For example, "Morning Workout" suggests Body, while "Team Meeting" suggests Heart. You can always adjust these suggestions.</p>
            
            <div class="tip-box">
                <strong>Getting Started Tip</strong>
                <p>Don't overthink your category choices when starting out. Pick what feels right intuitively—you can always refine later, and Brightli maintains your progress across category changes.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="guide-section">
            <h2>Step 4: Schedule Your First Activity</h2>
            <p>Let's create an activity you want to reflect on:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Tap the <strong>+</strong> button at the bottom of your screen</li>
                <li>Enter a descriptive title (e.g., "Morning Run," "Focus Time," "Catch up with Sarah")</li>
                <li>Select a category that fits this activity</li>
                <li>Set the date and time when you'll do this activity</li>
                <li>Add the expected duration</li>
                <li><strong>Important:</strong> Toggle "Activity Tracking" ON to enable reflections</li>
                <li>Optionally add notes for context</li>
                <li>Tap "Save"</li>
            </ol>
            
            <div class="info-box">
                <strong>Understanding Activity Tracking</strong>
                <p>Not every activity needs reflection. Activity Tracking is your way to tell Brightli which experiences you want to learn from. Free users can track 3 activities per week, while Premium users have unlimited tracking.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Pro Tips for Better Activities</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Be Specific:</strong> "30-min Morning Run in the park" is better than just "Exercise"</li>
                <li><strong>Use Context:</strong> Add notes about your starting mood, location, or goals</li>
                <li><strong>Set Recurring Activities:</strong> For regular habits, use recurring scheduling to save time</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="guide-section">
            <h2>Step 5: Complete and Reflect</h2>
            <p>This is where Brightli's magic happens—the reflection intelligence that helps you understand yourself.</p>
            
            <h3>Marking Activities Complete</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>After finishing your activity, tap on it from your main dashboard</li>
                <li>In the activity details popup, tap the three dots (⋯) menu</li>
                <li>Select "Complete"</li>
                <li>The activity moves to your Completed section</li>
            </ol>
            
            <h3>The Reflection Flow</h3>
            <p>If Activity Tracking was enabled, your completed activity appears in "Pending Reflections." Here's what happens when you tap it:</p>
            
            <h4>1. Rate Your Experience</h4>
            <p>Use the 1-5 star rating scale to capture how it went. You can even tap between stars for half-star ratings (like 3.5 or 4.5 stars). This rating is crucial—it helps Brightli detect patterns in your performance.</p>
            
            <h4>2. Choose Your Reflection Style</h4>
            <p>After rating, you have three options:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Answer Reflection Questions:</strong> Brightli generates 1-3 context-aware questions based on your rating, activity type, and history</li>
                <li><strong>Write Freely ("Something Different"):</strong> Skip questions and write your own thoughts</li>
                <li><strong>Skip This Time:</strong> Save just the rating without additional reflection</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>3. Experience Adaptive Questions</h4>
            <p>Brightli's reflection intelligence adapts to your patterns:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>First Time:</strong> "What surprised you about this experience?"</li>
                <li><strong>Improving (rising ratings):</strong> "What's working better this time? Can you do more of it?"</li>
                <li><strong>Declining (falling ratings):</strong> "This used to work well. What felt different today?"</li>
                <li><strong>Consistently High:</strong> "You're crushing it! What conditions help you maintain this?"</li>
                <li><strong>Consistently Low:</strong> "What would it take to make this more enjoyable or productive?"</li>
            </ul>
            
            <div class="tip-box">
                <strong>Quality Over Quantity</strong>
                <p>You don't need to write paragraphs. A thoughtful sentence or two capturing key details is perfect. Authenticity matters more than length—your reflections are private and designed to help you discover patterns.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="guide-section">
            <h2>Step 6: Discover Your Insights</h2>
            <p>After completing 10-15 activities with reflections, visit the Insights tab to see what Brightli has learned about you.</p>
            
            <h3>What You'll Discover</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Completion Patterns:</strong> When you're most consistent across different activity types</li>
                <li><strong>Mood & Energy Trends:</strong> Which activities boost or drain your energy</li>
                <li><strong>Optimal Timing:</strong> What times of day work best for different activities</li>
                <li><strong>Category Balance:</strong> How you're distributing attention across life areas</li>
                <li><strong>Rating Patterns:</strong> Which activities consistently deliver positive experiences</li>
            </ul>
            
            <div class="info-box">
                <strong>Insights Grow With You</strong>
                <p>The more you reflect, the more accurate and valuable your insights become. Brightli identifies subtle patterns you'd never notice on your own, like realizing outdoor activities boost your mood more than indoor ones, or that you're most creative in the late evening.</p>

            <p>Beyond activity reflections, use the Journal tab to capture longer-form thoughts, gratitude, or daily summaries. Premium users get unlimited journal entries with additional prompts.</p>
            
            <h3>Calendar View</h3>
            <p>Switch to Calendar view to see your activities across weeks and months. Great for identifying scheduling patterns or gaps in certain activity categories.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="guide-section">
            <h2>Tips for Success</h2>
            
            <h3>Start Small, Build Momentum</h3>
            <p>Begin with 2-3 tracked activities per week. This gives you enough data for insights without feeling overwhelming. As reflection becomes habitual, you can track more.</p>
            
            <h3>Be Consistent With Reflections</h3>
            <p>The real value comes from completing reflections regularly, not perfectly. Even brief responses help Brightli detect patterns that guide your growth.</p>
            
            <h3>Review Weekly</h3>
            <p>Set aside 5-10 minutes each week to review your Insights. Look for trends, surprises, and opportunities to optimize your activities.</p>
            
            <h3>Experiment With Categories</h3>
            <p>If Default categories don't resonate, try Lifestyle or Creative naming. Different frameworks help different people connect with their activities.</p>
            
            <h3>Use Notes for Context</h3>
            <p>When scheduling activities, add contextual notes: "feeling stressed," "trying new route," "first time solo." These details help you understand what influences your experience.</p>
            
            <h3>Enable Notifications</h3>
            <p>Turn on reflection reminders so you don't forget to capture your experiences while they're fresh. You can customize notification timing in Settings.</p>
